# COMPUTER-DISASSEMBLING-PROCESS
Computer Disassembly Process
The computer disassembly exercise began with essential safety precautions. We powered off the
system, unplugged all cables, and took measures to prevent static discharge. Using a screwdriver,
I carefully removed the screws securing the side panel of the desktop case and gently slid it off to
reveal the internal components.
We identified and safely removed the following hardware parts:
 Expansion Cards: Enhance system capabilities such as graphics processing and sound
output.
 RAM (Random Access Memory): Temporary memory that stores data for quick access
during active tasks.
 Motherboard: The central circuit board that connects all components. It houses sockets
for the CPU, RAM, and expansion cards.
 CPU (Central Processing Unit): Known as the brain of the computer, it controls all
operations and processes.
 Optical Drive: Reads and writes data to CDs and DVDs.
 Power Supply Unit: Converts AC power from the wall into DC power for internal
components.
 Cooling System: Prevents overheating during computer operation.
 Hard Drive: A storage device that contains the operating system, software, and user
files.
Challenges Encountered
During the disassembly process, we faced several challenges:
 Cable Disconnection: Disconnecting power and data cables was tricky, especially those
with locking mechanisms. We used gentle force and marked their original positions for
easier reassembly.
 Tight Screws: Some screws were overly tightened. I used a magnetic screwdriver and
applied steady pressure to avoid stripping them.
 Grounding Awareness: Maintaining proper grounding throughout the process was
crucial to avoid damaging sensitive components.
Despite these challenges, our patience and methodical approach ensured a successful outcome.
Learning Outcomes
The disassembly exercise provided valuable hands-on experience and deepened our
understanding of computer hardware. Key takeaways include:
 Gaining practical knowledge of component functions and their interconnections.
 Learning to identify and describe hardware using accurate technical terminology.
 Developing patience, precision, and problem-solving skills through real-world
challenges.
 Bridging the gap between theoretical learning and practical application, which
strengthened my interest in computer engineering and boosted my confidence in
exploring the field further.
